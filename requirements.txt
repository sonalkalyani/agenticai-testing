Feature: OHIP Partner Booking API v2

Description: 
A REST API that allows authorized third-party partners (e.g., Expedia, Booking.com) to create room reservations in the Oracle Opera Cloud.

Endpoints:
POST /api/v2/bookings

Business Rules:
1. Authentication: Requires a valid OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token.
2. Rate Limiting: Partners are limited to 100 requests per minute. Exceeding this returns HTTP 429.
3. Validation: 
   - 'guest_count' must be between 1 and 4.
   - 'check_in_date' cannot be in the past.
   - 'room_type' must match available inventory.
4. Payment: If 'payment_method' is "CREDIT_CARD", a mock validation is performed.

Known Risks:
- High traffic expected during holiday seasons.
- Duplicate bookings have occurred in v1 if the network times out.
